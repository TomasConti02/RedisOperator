Hi, i'm **Tomas Conti**, and this is my **Computer Engineer thesis project**.
It is the Redis Operator code to **backup and restart a Redis Cluster in Kubernetes**. 
I developed it using the Kubebuilder framework, with Longhorn as the storage provider.
## Description
RedisOperator is a Kubernetes operator developed using the Kubebuilder framework to manage Redis clusters. It use Longhorn as a storage provider, allowing fast recovery and backup of Redis clusters using VolumeSnapshots. This solution ensures data persistence and quick cluster restarts, making it ideal for applications that require high availability and low downtime.
## Introduction
I create the execution environment with **two Ubuntu 22.04 VM**. I use [K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start) for deploy a light Kubernetes version. 

In addition, I deployed a [Longhorn](https://docs.vultr.com/how-to-install-longhorn-on-kubernetes) **storage provider** inside the Kubernetes environment to **allow VolumeSnapshot creation**.
## Getting Started
The custom controller code is inside the file **internal/controller/redis_controller.go**, where I create the entire execution logic of the operator. Inside the file **api/redis_type.go**, I define the Redis Operator CRD struct.
## Manifests
## CRD.yaml [RedisOperator is a CRD]
```yaml
apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1
kind: Redis
metadata:
  name: redis-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  size: 1
````
---------------------------------------------------------------------
## StorageClass.yaml [longhorn provider]
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: longhorn-new
provisioner: driver.longhorn.io
parameters:
  numberOfReplicas: "1"
  staleReplicaTimeout: "30"
  fromBackup: ""
  fsType: ext4
  dataLocality: disabled
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
````
---------------------------------------------------------------------
## VolumeSnapshotClass.yaml [longhorn provider]
```yaml
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: new-volumesnapshotclass-longhorn
driver: driver.longhorn.io
deletionPolicy: Delete
parameters:
  type: snap
````
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Create the Redis Operator Project Setting 
```
kubebuilder init --domain example.com --repo github.com/username/redis-operator
kubebuilder create api --group cache --version v1 --kind Redis
mkdir -p ~/RedisOperator
cd ~/RedisOperator
go mod init example.com/RedisOperator
kubebuilder init --domain=example.com --repo=example.com/RedisOperator
kubebuilder create api --group cache --version v1 --kind Redis
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------
## testing on ~/RedisOperator
```
make manifests
make install
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
make run
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/redisoperator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/redisoperator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/redisoperator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/redisoperator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
